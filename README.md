# 🔵 Othello AI ⚪

Welcome to this Othello project!  
This is a complete implementation of the classic Othello board game, featuring an artificial intelligence opponent and a simple graphical interface.

At the heart of this project is an AI based on the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning**, enabling it to make strategic decisions by exploring game possibilities several moves ahead.
